# ObbyGame
> This Roblox game was an exercise for me to learn how to use [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com) and get back into the rhythm making a Roblox game again. This game isn't going to be AAA quality but I think it'll be a decent game.

This game generates a random obby for players to complete. This game is designed to be able to be built and published without having to go into the place-file and edit anything.

## Playing the game
You can either [click here](https://www.roblox.com/games/6026623952/Obby-Game) to play the game or if you want to build it locally you can run `rojo build` (as long as you have [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) installed).

Eventually I do want to have this place just auto-build and publish whenever I create a release on the GitHub page, but right now I'm just gonna focus on making the game for a bit.
